## Project Introduction
The Coursera dataset project focuses on analyzing various aspects of online course offerings and engagement metrics, particularly through data on courses, certificate types, ratings, difficulty levels, and student enrollment figures. With the growth in demand for online education, understanding the dynamics behind course popularity and student engagement has become crucial. This analysis aims to explore trends, preferences, and factors influencing student enrollment in different types of courses and certification programs on Coursera, one of the world’s leading online learning platforms.

The dataset includes information on:

- **Course Titles:** Descriptions of individual courses
- **Course Organizations:** Institutions or companies providing the courses
- **Certificate Types:** The nature of certification offered.
- **Course Ratings:** Average student ratings for each course
- **Difficulty Levels:** Ratings of courses based on learner difficulty
- **Enrollment Numbers:** The total number of students enrolled in each course
This dataset presents an opportunity to generate insights about user preferences and behaviour, which can inform future course offerings and marketing strategies for online learning platforms.

#### Project Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

- **Understand Enrollment Patterns:** Identify trends in student enrollment based on course characteristics such as ratings, difficulty level, and certificate type. This will provide insights into what attracts the highest student engagement.

- **Examine Course Popularity by Certificate Type:** Analyze whether specific certificate types, like Specializations or Professional Certificates, correlate with higher enrollments and ratings, highlighting preferred learning formats among users.

- **Evaluate Rating and Engagement Correlation:** Assess if higher-rated courses attract more enrollments and examine any notable patterns among courses with high ratings versus lower ratings.

- **Analyze Difficulty Level Preferences:** Investigate the relationship between course difficulty levels and enrollment numbers to determine whether beginner, intermediate, or advanced courses are more popular among Coursera users.

#### Steps
The first step carried out was to download the ‘Coursera Course’ dataset from Kaggle [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/siddharthm1698/coursera-course-dataset]

The dataset was imported to Jupyter Notebook for cleaning and analysis.
